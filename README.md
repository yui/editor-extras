YUI Editor Extras
=================

This is a collection of text editor syntax files for the YUI Library. In time,
we'd like to expand it to include snippets, plugins, and other editor extras.

Currently, there are YUI 3 syntax files for TextMate, Vim, and
TextMate-compatible editors like Sublime Text 2 and E.

The YUI 3 syntax files are generated automatically from the latest YUI 3 API
data by the `build.js` script.
