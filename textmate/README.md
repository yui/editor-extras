YUI TextMate Extras
===================

This directory contains extras for working with YUI in TextMate and other
editors that support TextMate bundles, such as Sublime Text and E.


Contents
--------

  * **HTML (Selleck).tmLanguage**: Language syntax for YUI's Selleck
    documentation files, which are a mixture of HTML, Handlebars/Mustache, and
    some custom syntax.

  * **JavaScript - YUI 3.tmLanguage**: Language syntax for JavaScript files
    containing YUI 3 code. This file is automatically generated; don't edit it
    by hand.


Installation
------------

Double-click on a `.tmLanguage` file to install it in TextMate. For other
editors that support TextMate bundles, you're on your own.
